# Germanium BJT SPICE Models

Germanium BJT SPICE models based on parameters extracted from vintage OC44 and AC128 components by Holmes, Holters, and van Walstijn, as presented in [“Comparison of Germanium Bipolar Junction Transistor Models for Real-Time Circuit Simulation”, Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects, Edinburgh, Scotland, Sept. 2017](http://benholmes.co.uk/publication/2017-09-05-Comparison%20of%20Germanium%20BJT%20models).
